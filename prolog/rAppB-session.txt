exEn1 uses a simple 9 item grammar to illustrate a simplified wh-movement,
in which the moved element, which food, occurs in two sets.
As usual, type ; to display alternative parses...

exXX2, exXX4, exXX8 use a simple 6 item grammar to illustrate parses
of the copy language {xx| x in {a,b}*}.
It is a good test for MG parses -- it uses all the rules and has many movements.
Since numeration order does not matter, it is not obvious that this is the
copy language until you linearize the derivations!
The whole grammar is given as the numeration in exXX4.
As usual, type ; to display alternative parses...

exGa0, exGa00, exGa000, exGa1, exGa2, use a simple grammar to illustrate parses
of unbounded flat coordination in Irish Gaelic, inspired by Bennett, Elfner and McCloskey 2016.
Any number of coordinates is OK!
As usual, type ; to display alternative parses...

exGa3, exGa4 use a simple grammar to illustrate parses
of adjoined relative clauses and adjectives in Irish Gaelic.
Any number of adjuncts is OK!
As usual, type ; to display alternative parses...
